Summary:
Anime Boston is a three-day event that takes place every year in Boston, Massachusetts, the USA and sponsored by the New England Anime Society.
Our aim is to stir up and enjoy Japanese animation, manga and pop-culture.
This event started in April 2003, and since then it has occupied an important position in the Northeast American anime events.
***As the number of participants has been significantly increasing, and the event*** has been moved the location from the Boston Park Plaza Hotel to the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston and expanded to the size that anyone did not imagine in the first year.
The event containes not only Japanese culture and manga, but all other Japanese genres such as J-Pop, J-Rock, live actions end etc to promote comprehensive understanding of Japanese history and traditional culture by participants.
All over 350 staff are volunteers.
Everyone loves anime, that is why the event's preparation is throughout the year.
The preparation for the following year event will start soon after the event of this year is over.
The staff has very diverse personal history, all strive to realize the best plan.
Of course, this event is made up not only by staff, but by fans support as well.
The event which started from 4,000 participants in 2003, recorded more than 22,000 participants in 2012.
Panel events are also held by volunteer fans, and people participate in the event with the thought that each person belongs to the community.
