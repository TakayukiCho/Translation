Summary:
AnimeNEXT is the anime event that is ***independently*** held in New Jersey and New York.
We are engaged in numerous projects: invitation of Japanese anime creators and manga artists, voice actors and J-POP artists; sales and exhibitions of anime goods, workshops in panel exhibitions, game areas and so on.
The event focuses on anime, manga and Japanese culture, and with the rising popularity of anime and manga from the 1990s to the 2000s, the number of participants is growing year by year.
The first AnimeNEXT was held in 2002.
***This event is operated by Universal Animation.***
