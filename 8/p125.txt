Summary:
"Fancy Frontier Animation Festival" is a manga and anime event which has been held since October, 2002.
its purpose is "to be filled with creativity and vitality like lively Comic Market".
It is the biggest anime, manga and doujinshi event in Taiwan.
In Taiwan, even other "only"-events have the number of the guests from several thousand to nearly 10,000.
It became the place of advertising and an overseas event marketing for Japanese anime, manga, game companies and related industries in Taiwan.
The event focuses mainly on the doujinshi sale and interaction among clubs, but at the same time a lot of companies of Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong also participate.
Mini-lives, voice actors' events, writers' roundtable discussions and cosplay contests are held at the stage.
Because spot sale is a main part of this event, cosplayers perform outside the venue.
The exhibition of Itasha (car decorated with images) takes place at specified parking area, according to the regulations of each venue.
"Fancy Frontier", as an event-organizer, believes that the event must provide various spaces where participants can interact with each other.
We want to provide the opportunities for the creators to acquire business chances and for all participants to provide fun time.
We would like the media and public to understanding us deeper and learn the world of anime and manga.
