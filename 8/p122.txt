Summary: 
The first CWT was held in March 2002, the number of participating clubs was only 500.
The number of clubs was doubled every year since 2002, and its number has exceeded 5000 until August 2014. But there are no venues where 5000 clubs can be stored in Taipei, so we decided to elect only 3000 clubs.
CWT has watched over the passion and creative power of Taiwanese young creators for 13 years since 2002. 
Our future goal is to deepen the relationship between Taiwan and Japan even more with Japanese pop-culture events.
