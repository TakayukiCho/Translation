Summary:
AnimeparTy is large event of the subculture festival.
SOLOYO (an organizer) holds this event once a year in China (Shanghai).
There are Japanese anime related exhibits, talk shows and live shows of famous voice actors and animators.
We offer live performances based on Japanese artists' work which you can often see in Niko Niko Douga of Japan
We introduce sessions of "Tried to sing" and "Tried to dance" which became popular enough among Chinese cosplayers to be the main platform for them to show their dojin work.
Furthermore, we make effort on sales of official goods in cooperation with Japanese companies in order to dispel the idea that counterfeit products circulate in China.
