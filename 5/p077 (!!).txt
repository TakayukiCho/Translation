Summary:
AniNite is the largest Japanese pop-culture fans' convention in Austria that is held every year and operated by AniManga.
Everything began in 2001.
Several volunteers decided to expand night of enjoying the movies and video game into larger event so that more people could enjoy it.
The first event gathered about 70 people, they were watching movies and anime together, playing video games ... AniNite was born!
The number of participants increased more than doubling each time in next events, and the size of the venue was expanded.
The first contest "Austrian Otaku Award" was held during the event in 2003, more fans took part in the event, and people liked this event because they could meet a like-minded persons.
Since then, AniNite has followed a long way to today, continuing challenging by gathering fans and providing them a platform for a simple mission to serve as a bridge between different cultures and different faiths.
