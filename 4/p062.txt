Summary:
J'Fest(R) Expo is the festival that introduces state-of-the-art Asian entertainment industry in Mexico.
This event exhibits fashion, music and other popular Japanese culture.
This event is held in Mexico City for 2 days in nice spring weather and consist of exhibition of art, music events, workshops and stage performances.
The major difference from other events is that it is focused on Japanese music and fashion instead of anime and manga that many events take up.
We divide this event into three main floors for each theme.
"Shibuya" area introduces Japanese fashion and Japanese rock, "Akihabara" area introduces J-pop and Japanese anime, and "Harajuku" area will appear in 2017 and be focused on Japanese "cute culture".
